                    Anime is a form of illustration used in video format often seen in shows. Often people believe that Anime is Japan exclusive but that is a common misconception.
                    Anime first started Jan 1, 1963 with Astro Boy (Mighty Atom), a long running Japanese kids show animated by Mushi production and adapted from the manga by Osamu Tezuka.
                    This sparked a long running style of shows called anime that has evolved over the last few years into something much bigger than ever expected, people have even gotten married over their love for specific anime.
